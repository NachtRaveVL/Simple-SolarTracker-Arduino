sentence=Helioduino: Simple automation controller for solar tracking systems.
paragraph=Allows one to set up a system of panels, servos, LDRs, relays, and other objects useful in controlling both single and double axis sun tracking solar panel systems, and provides data monitoring & collection abilities while operating panel axis servos and/or linear actuators across the day as the sun moves to maintain optimal panel alignment. Works with a large variety of widely-available aquarium/hobbyist equipment, including popular GPS, RTC, EEPROM, SD card, WiFi, and other modules compatible with Arduino. Can be setup to calculate sun position accurately as possible or to auto-balance two opposing photoresistors per panel axis. With the right setup Helioduino can automatically do things like: drive large panels with linear actuators, use power sensing to auto-optimize daily panel offset, spray/wipe panels on routine to keep panels clean, deploy/retract panels at sunrise/sunset, or even provide panel heating during cold temperatures or when ice is detected.
