sentence=Helioduino: Simple automation controller for solar tracking systems.
paragraph=Allows one to set up a system of panels, servos, LDRs, relays, and other objects useful in controlling both single and dual axis sun tracking solar panel systems, and provides data monitoring & collection abilities while operating panel axis servos and/or linear actuators across the day as the sun moves to maintain optimal panel alignment. Works with a large variety of widely-available aquarium/hobbyist equipment, including popular GPS, RTC, EEPROM, SD card, WiFi, and other modules compatible with Arduino. Can be setup to calculate sun position accurately as possible or to auto-balance two opposing photoresistors per panel axis. With the right setup Helioduino can automatically do things like: drive large panels with multiple in-step linear actuators, engaging axis brakes to prevent large panels from moving/taking strain off motors that can then disengage, spray/wipe panels on routine to keep panels clean, deploy panels at sunrise and retract at sunset or when its too windy out, remind when to realign panels, or even provide panel heating during cold temperatures or when ice is detected.
